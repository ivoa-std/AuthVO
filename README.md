# Authentication in the VO

This document describes how services in the
[Virtual Observatory](https://ivoa.net)
can advertise their support for authentication methods,
especially for use by non-browser clients.

## Document Naming

Note this document has undergone some name changes in its history;
an earlier version was called IAP (Interoperable Authentication Protocol).
The repository was renamed from IAP to AuthVO on 13 June 2025.

## Access and usage

Stable versions of this document may become available through the
